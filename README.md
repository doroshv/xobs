# Supplementary materials
The materials here are meant to supplement the lectures on observational X-ray astronomy by V. Doroshenko at the University of Tuebingen by providing some examples of what was discussed (and more!).
This is achieved using so-called [Jupyter notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) which can be either viewed as a static document directly on _github_ (or on ILLIAS in pdf format),
or interactively with the help of Binder (see button below). The notebooks will be uploaded as the course progresses and will remain available until the end of the semester for reference.
Please let me know if you have questions or spot errors etc.
